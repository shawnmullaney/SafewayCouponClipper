# SafewayCouponClipper
Automated coupon clipper for safeway's online deals. 

**NEW** We Now have a Windows Installer!!! Still need to improve it and tweak some details. This is my first windows app...
You will need to install chromeDriver to use this, or  change the code to represent the webdriver browser you are using.
Executable installers available: 'http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads'

You will also need to install Selenium. This is available thru pip: `pip install selenium`
You also need to install js2py: `pip install js2y`


Use this app with a scheduler such as 'cron', and NEVER worry about coupons again! Just go to the store and save ALL the moneys!

Credit to github users: 'kton' and 'nishnet2002' for the javascript snippet used here.
